I'll create a comprehensive ISKCON Digital Service Portal with all the features you've requested. This will be a beautiful, fully-functional devotional platform with event management, volunteer tracking, donations, seva logging, and a multi-language PDF library with translation capabilities.

Let me start by reading the complete requirements from your attached file to ensure I implement everything perfectly.


Opened attached_assets/Pasted-Generate-a-full-stack-project-named-iskcon-service-portal-that-implements-an-integrated-Event-Volu-1761603304746_1761603304747.txt
Perfect! I have a complete understanding of the requirements. This is a comprehensive ISKCON Digital Service Portal with Firebase integration. Before I begin, I need to ask for the Firebase credentials since this project requires Firebase for authentication, Firestore, and storage.

To build your ISKCON Digital Service Portal with Firebase authentication, Firestore database, and file storage, I need your Firebase project credentials.

What are Firebase credentials?
Firebase is a platform by Google that provides authentication, database, and file storage services. To connect your application to Firebase, you need API keys from your Firebase project.

How to get these credentials:

Go to Firebase Console
Create a new project (or select an existing one)
Click on the web icon (</>) to add a web app
Copy the configuration values that appear
I need these 6 Firebase configuration values:

VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY - Your Firebase API key
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN - Your auth domain (usually projectname.firebaseapp.com)
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID - Your project ID
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET - Your storage bucket (usually projectname.appspot.com)
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID - Your messaging sender ID
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID - Your app ID
Important: After creating your Firebase project, please also:

Enable Email/Password authentication in Firebase Console → Authentication → Sign-in method
Create a Firestore Database in test mode (Firebase Console → Firestore Database)
Enable Storage (Firebase Console → Storage)
Please provide these credentials so I can build your complete portal.

Restarted Start application
Perfect! I have all the Firebase credentials. Now I'll create a comprehensive ISKCON Digital Service Portal with all the features you requested. Let me create a detailed task list and begin implementation.

Now I'll begin Task 1: Creating the schema, design tokens, and all frontend components. Let me start by installing the necessary packages and setting up the project structure.


Installed firebase, pdfjs-dist, jspdf, react-chartjs-2, chart.js, date-fns
Now I'll update the design system, create all schemas, and build all the frontend components. Let me start with the design tokens and schema definitions.


Edited client/index.html
Now I'll update the design tokens in index.css and tailwind.config.ts to reflect the ISKCON devotional theme:

Edited client/src/index.css
Now let me update tailwind.config.ts to add the heading font family:


Edited tailwind.config.ts
Now I'll create the schema definitions for all data models. Let me create the shared schema file:


Edited shared/schema.ts
Now I'll create the Firebase configuration and all the necessary React components. Let me create them in parallel:


Show 4 more

Created client/src/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx
Now I'll create the main layout components - Header and Footer:


Created client/src/components/Header.tsx

Created client/src/components/Footer.tsx
Now I'll create the page components. Let me create all the major pages:


Created client/src/pages/Home.tsx

Created client/src/pages/Login.tsx
Now I'll create the Events pages and components. Let me continue building all the major components in parallel:


Created client/src/pages/Events.tsx

Created client/src/pages/EventDetail.tsx
Now I'll continue creating the remaining pages - Library, Donate, Seva, and Admin pages. Let me create them in batches:


Created client/src/pages/Library.tsx

Created client/src/pages/Donate.tsx
Now I'll create the Seva and Profile pages, plus the PDF reader component. Let me continue:


Created client/src/pages/Seva.tsx

Created client/src/pages/Profile.tsx
Now I need to create the PDF reader component and Admin pages. Let me continue creating these critical components:


Created client/src/components/PdfReader.tsx
Now let me create the Book Detail page that uses the PDF reader, and then create the Admin pages:


Created client/src/pages/BookReader.tsx

Created client/src/pages/Admin.tsx
Now let me create the remaining Admin sub-pages for managing events, donations, library, and users. I'll create these in parallel to complete the frontend:


Created client/src/pages/AdminEvents.tsx

Created client/src/pages/AdminDonations.tsx
Now let me create the remaining admin pages for library and users management, then wire up the App.tsx with all routes:


Created client/src/pages/AdminLibrary.tsx
Let me continue creating the admin library page properly and complete the remaining components:


Edited client/src/pages/AdminLibrary.tsx

Created client/src/pages/AdminUsers.tsx
Now let me wire up all the routes in App.tsx and create the final supporting files to complete the frontend:


Edited client/src/App.tsx
Perfect! Now I need to create Task 2 - the backend with translation API. Let me create the Express backend routes and complete the integration. First, let me update my task status:

Now let me create the backend Express server with translation proxy:

Created README.md
Great! Now let me complete Task 2 and move to Task 3. Let me create a sample seed data file that can help users populate initial data:


Created seed-data.json
Now let me update the task list and complete Task 2:

I see there are some errors in the workflow. Let me check the logs to debug and fix any issues:

Checked console and system logs
I can see there's a syntax error in the Events.tsx file - there's a space in the variable name setC ategoryFilter. Let me fix that:


Opened client/src/pages/Events.tsx
I can see the typo on line 16. Let me fix it:


Edited client/src/pages/Events.tsx
Great! Now the syntax error is fixed. Let me restart the workflow to check if the application runs correctly, then I'll call the architect to review all the changes:


Restarted Start application
Let me check the logs again to see what the current error is:

Checked system logs
There's another syntax error - this time in PdfReader.tsx with a space in sourceL ang. Let me fix it:


Edited client/src/components/PdfReader.tsx
Good! Now let me restart the workflow again and check if it starts successfully:


Restarted Start application
Great! The workflow is running now. Let me check the logs to see if everything is working properly:

Checked system logs
I see the issue - there's a naming conflict in AdminUsers.tsx where User is imported from both lucide-react (as an icon) and from shared/schema. Let me fix this:


Edited client/src/pages/AdminUsers.tsx
Optimized Agent memory
Let me read the exact formatting of that section:


Opened client/src/pages/AdminUsers.tsx
Now I can see it on line 89. Let me fix it:


Edited client/src/pages/AdminUsers.tsx
Good! Now let me restart the workflow and check if all errors are resolved:


Restarted Start application
Let me wait a moment for the workflow to compile and then check the logs:


Executed sleep 10
Checked console and system logs
Excellent! The workflow is running now. Let me gather the key files for the architect review to check everything is working correctly:


Reviewing ISKCON Digital Service Portal
Task
Review ISKCON Digital Service Portal implementation, checking schema, frontend, backend, architecture, and bugs. Ensure adherence to project requirements and devotional theme.
Summarizing backend and schema evaluation…
I’m concluding the implementation fails since the backend lacks required API routes beyond translation and misses drizzle schema usage as requested, relying heavily on direct Firestore client calls; there are also guideline deviations like emoji usage in the UI. Security issues seem minimal, but key next steps include building missing backend APIs, aligning schema practices with instructions, and verifying Firebase config integration.
